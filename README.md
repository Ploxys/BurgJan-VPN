# BurgJan

## **A proxy server‚Äìclient resistant to blocking**

‚∏ª

## üß© Overview

BurgJan achieves resilience by fully imitating HTTPS traffic and DNS requests.

By default, DNS queries are spoofed to look like requests to VKontakte, but you can easily change this in the client and server code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è In the future, this will be configurable via commands (currently in development).

‚∏ª

## üöÄ How It Works

The client sends a request to the server that looks like a regular HTTP connection, which then transitions into TLS.
The DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) system assumes it‚Äôs a normal encrypted connection.
A fake website (which you can customize) is attached to the same port where BurgJan runs, further increasing the disguise level of the tunnel.

## DNS Obfuscation Mode 

In DNS mode, the request is sent as a DNS query to the proxy.
The DPI thinks it‚Äôs a regular DNS exchange, since both the request and response appear normal.
In reality, a secure connection is established and instantly encrypted ‚Äî effectively confusing DPI systems.

üîê Security Notice ‚Äî CRITICAL

# **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: The certificate located in the sec/ directory MUST be replaced with your own before deploying BurgJan in production.**

Using the default certificate poses a serious security risk ‚Äî anyone with access to the public version can decrypt your traffic.

Generate a New Certificate

Using OpenSSL

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout sec/key.pem -out sec/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

Using Certbot (Let‚Äôs Encrypt)

sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com

After obtaining your certificate, update paths in the server configuration.
